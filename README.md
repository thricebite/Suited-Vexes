# Suited Vexes

This resource pack suits up your vexes to attack in style! This was inspired by these [Minecraft skins](https://namemc.com/profile/thricebite.1).

**Suited Vexes uses and requires Optifine custom and random textures to function.** Other resource packs that also modifies vexes using Optifine features *might* conflict with this resource pack. 
Here are some mods to enable Optifine custom and random texture features: 
- Entity Texture Features: https://modrinth.com/mod/entitytexturefeatures
- Optifine: https://www.optifine.net/home

Please check out the [gallery](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/suitedvexes/gallery
) to check out some vex models.
